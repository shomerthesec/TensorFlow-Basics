# Projects in Tensorflow

### in this repo I'm going to publish my projects that I will do in Tensorflow hopefully.

* the first couple of commits and projects will be from " Tensorflow In Practice Specialization " on coursera.
* please download the .ipynb and open it with jupyter or collab, because there is something wrong with the visualization of my markdowns between jupyter markdown and github.
